# NODETACH DELETE Testing Results

## Summary
The NODETACH DELETE functionality has been successfully implemented and tested in FalkorDB. Both the parser and execution engine are working correctly.

## Parser Testing Results ✅
All NODETACH DELETE syntax variations parse correctly:
- `NODETACH DELETE n` ✅
- `MATCH (n) WHERE n.age > 30 NODETACH DELETE n` ✅  
- `MATCH (n:Person) NODETACH DELETE n` ✅
- `MATCH (n:Person) NODETACH DELETE n RETURN count(*)` ✅
- `MATCH (n:Person) WHERE n.age > 30 NODETACH DELETE n` ✅

## Execution Testing Results ✅

### Basic Functionality
1. **Simple node deletion**: `NODETACH DELETE n` works correctly when node has no relationships
   - Result: "Nodes deleted: 1"

2. **Relationship constraint enforcement**: NODETACH DELETE correctly fails when node has relationships
   - Query: `MATCH (n:Person {name: 'Alice'}) NODETACH DELETE n` (where Alice has relationships)
   - Result: `(error) Cannot delete node: node has relationships. Use DETACH DELETE to delete a node and its relationships.`
   - This is the **key behavior** that differentiates NODETACH DELETE from regular DELETE

3. **After relationship removal**: NODETACH DELETE works after relationships are manually deleted
   - Delete relationships first: `MATCH ()-[r:FRIENDS]->() DELETE r`
   - Then delete node: `MATCH (n:Person {name: 'Alice'}) NODETACH DELETE n` ✅

### Advanced Scenarios
4. **WITH RETURN clause**: `MATCH (n:Person) NODETACH DELETE n RETURN count(*)` ✅
   - Returns count of deleted nodes correctly

5. **WITH WHERE clause**: `MATCH (n:Person) WHERE n.age > 30 NODETACH DELETE n RETURN n.name` ✅
   - Correctly filters and deletes only nodes matching condition
   - Returns properties of deleted nodes

## Test Environment
- **Parser**: libcypher-parser with manual NODETACH DELETE grammar additions
- **Execution**: FalkorDB server with Redis module
- **Commands tested via**: redis-cli GRAPH.QUERY

## Key Behavioral Differences from Regular DELETE
| Scenario | Regular DELETE | NODETACH DELETE |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Node with no relationships | ✅ Deletes node | ✅ Deletes node |
| Node with relationships | ✅ Deletes node + relationships | ❌ Fails with error |
| Error message | N/A | "Cannot delete node: node has relationships. Use DETACH DELETE..." |

## Implementation Status
- [x] Parser support (cypher-parser grammar)
- [x] Execution engine support (FalkorDB)
- [x] Error handling for constraint violations
- [x] Integration with WHERE clauses
- [x] Integration with RETURN clauses
- [x] Proper relationship preservation

## Conclusion
The NODETACH DELETE feature is fully functional and provides the expected semantics:
- Deletes nodes that have no relationships
- Prevents deletion of nodes with relationships (preserving graph integrity)
- Provides clear error messages when constraints are violated
- Integrates properly with other Cypher clauses (WHERE, RETURN, MATCH)

This implementation successfully extends FalkorDB's DELETE capabilities while maintaining data integrity through relationship preservation.
