### RedisGraph is now in maintenance mode.

### As of July 5th, 2023 RedisGraph is no longer under active development. We do not plan to release new features (2.12 is the last feature-bearing release), but we will continue to release patches until January 31, 2025.

### We are grateful to the RedisGraph community for their interest and support.
