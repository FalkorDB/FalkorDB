"""Per-query performance harness for FalkorDB.

Layered so that each piece can be tested without a running server:

  model      value types (Query, Metric) — no I/O
  queries    the canonical query set and graph setup — data only
  metrics    CSV parsing, ratios, thresholds, normalisation — pure functions
  client     the falkordb-py control plane: server lifecycle, setup, probes
  counters   per-process instruction/cycle backends (rusage / perf / none)
  measure    the full-set measurement loop
  callgrind  deterministic instruction counts by differencing two runs
  compare    local regression gate      } both on `metrics`, so a local verdict
  report     the CI markdown comment    } and the CI comment cannot disagree
  profile    samply profile of one query
  flow       per-flow-test-file measurement

The measurement boundary is deliberate and load-bearing: anything *inside* a
counter window is a C binary (`redis-benchmark`, or `redis-cli -r N` under
callgrind), because the counters either window on a subprocess lifetime or are
system-wide and would otherwise absorb this process's own work. `client` is
only ever used *outside* a measurement window.
