"""Local regression gate: one measurement CSV against a baseline CSV.

Shares `metrics` with `report`, which is the point. This gate used to have its
own parsing, its own ratio function and its own thresholds, and consequently its
own answer: it compared raw wall-clock at 1.25x, which across two hosts is a
noise detector — the very thing the rest of the harness refuses to do. It now
inherits the control-row normalisation and the non-positive-baseline guard that
only the CI reporter had.

Baselines are not committed (bench/.gitignore ignores baseline/): a checked-in
baseline goes stale the moment anything lands and then reports phantom
regressions for everyone. Produce your own from a base build.

Caveat worth knowing before trusting a verdict: the baseline is a single file,
so after switching branches this compares against numbers measured somewhere
else, silently. And a baseline from another machine is not comparable at all —
per-host speed differences alone measured 1.46x.
