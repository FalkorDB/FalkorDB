# IMPORTANT: HOW TO USE FalkorDB GITHUB ISSUES

Github issues SHOULD ONLY BE USED to report bugs, and for DETAILED feature
requests. Everything else belongs to the FalkorDB [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/FalkorDB/discussions).

PLEASE DO NOT POST GENERAL QUESTIONS that are not about bugs or suspected
bugs in the Github issues system. We'll be very happy to help you and provide
all the support in the [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/FalkorDB/discussions).

Issues and pull requests for documentation belong on the FalkorDB documentation repository:

    https://github.com/FalkorDB/falkordb.github.io

If you are reporting a security bug or vulnerability, see SECURITY.md.

# How to provide a patch for a new feature

    a. Fork FalkorDB on github ( https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo )
    b. Create a topic branch (git checkout -b my_branch)
    c. Push to your branch (git push origin my_branch)
    d. Initiate a pull request on github ( https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request )
