%%MatrixMarket matrix array pattern symmetric
%%GraphBLAS type int64_t
% This is supposed to be full 3-by-3 matrix that is
% also "iso-valued" (all entries equal to 1).  This
% gets detected as a "pattern" matrix, but "array pattern"
% is an invalid combination in the Matrix Market format.
% This matrix should be written in "coordinate pattern"
% format instead.
