I would like to thank Jeremy Kepner (MIT Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing
Center), and the GraphBLAS API Committee: Ayd\i n Bulu\c{c} (Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory), Timothy G. Mattson (Intel Corporation) Scott McMillan
(Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University), Jos\'e Moreira
(IBM Corporation), Carl Yang (UC Davis), and Benjamin Brock (UC Berkeley), for
creating the GraphBLAS specification and for patiently answering my many
questions while I was implementing it.

I would like to thank Tim Mattson and Henry Gabb, Intel, Inc., for their
collaboration and for the support of Intel.

I would like to thank Joe Eaton and Corey Nolet for their collaboration on the
CUDA kernels (still in progress), and for the support of NVIDIA.

I would like to thank Pat Quillen for his
collaboration and for the support of MathWorks.

I would like to thank John Eaton for his collaboration on the integration
with Octave 7.

I would like to thank Michel Pelletier for his collaboration and work on the
pygraphblas interface, and Jim Kitchen and Erik Welch for their work on
Anaconda's python interface.

I would like to thank Will Kimmerer for his collaboration and work on the
Julia interface.

I would like to thank John Gilbert (UC Santa Barbara) for our many discussions
on GraphBLAS, and for our decades-long conversation and collaboration on sparse
matrix computations.

I would like to thank S\'ebastien Villemot (Debian Developer,
\url{http://sebastien.villemot.name}) for helping me with various build issues
and other code issues with GraphBLAS (and all of SuiteSparse) for its packaging
in Debian Linux.

I would like to thank G{\'{a}}bor Sz{\'{a}}rnyas for porting the \verb'@GrB'
interface to Octave 7 on Apple Silicon.

I would like to thank Markus M\"{u}tzel
for his help in porting the updates
to GraphBLAS v7.4.1 and SuiteSparse v7.0.0 to Windows.

I would like to thank Roi Lipman, Redis (\url{https://falkordb.com}), for
our many discussions on GraphBLAS and for enabling its use in RedisGraph and FalkorDB, a graph
database module for Redis.  Based on SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS, FalkorDB is up
600x faster than the fastest graph databases ({\footnotesize

SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS was developed with support from
NVIDIA, Intel, MIT Lincoln Lab, MathWorks, Redis, FalkorDB, IBM,
the National Science Foundation (1514406, 1835499), and Julia Computing.
