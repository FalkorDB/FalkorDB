\label{descriptor}

A GraphBLAS {\em descriptor} modifies the behavior of a GraphBLAS operation.
If the descriptor is \verb'GrB_NULL', defaults are used.

The access to these parameters and their values is governed
by two \verb'enum' types, \verb'GrB_Desc_Field' and \verb'GrB_Desc_Value':

\begin{mdframed}[userdefinedwidth=6in]

typedef enum

    GrB_OUTP = 0,   // descriptor for output of a method
    GrB_MASK = 1,   // descriptor for the mask input of a method

    GrB_INP1 = 3,   // descriptor for the second input of a method
    GxB_AxB_METHOD = 1000, // descriptor for selecting C=A*B algorithm

GrB_Desc_Value ;

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb'GrB_OUTP' is a parameter that modifies the output of a
    GraphBLAS operation.  In the default case, the output is not cleared, and
    ${\bf Z = C \odot T}$ then ${\bf C \langle M \rangle = Z}$ are computed
    as-is, where ${\bf T}$ is the results of the particular GraphBLAS
    operation.

    In the non-default case, ${\bf Z = C \odot T}$ is first computed, using the
    results of ${\bf T}$ and the accumulator $\odot$.  After this is done, if
    the \verb'GrB_OUTP' descriptor field is set to \verb'GrB_REPLACE', then the
    output is cleared of its entries.  Next, the assignment ${\bf C \langle M
    \rangle = Z}$ is performed.

\item \verb'GrB_MASK' is a parameter that modifies the \verb'Mask',
    even if the mask is not present.

    If this parameter is set to its default value, and if the mask is not
    present (\verb'Mask==NULL') then implicitly \verb'Mask(i,j)=1' for all
    \verb'i' and \verb'j'.  If the mask is present then \verb'Mask(i,j)=1'
    means that \verb'C(i,j)' is to be modified by the ${\bf C \langle M \rangle
    = Z}$ update.  Otherwise, if \verb'Mask(i,j)=0', then \verb'C(i,j)' is not
    modified, even if \verb'Z(i,j)' is an entry with a different value; that
    value is simply discarded.

    If the \verb'GrB_MASK' parameter is set to \verb'GrB_COMP', then the
    use of the mask is complemented.  In this case, if the mask is not present
    (\verb'Mask==NULL') then implicitly \verb'Mask(i,j)=0' for all \verb'i' and
    \verb'j'.  This means that none of ${\bf C}$ is modified and the entire
    computation of ${\bf Z}$ might as well have been skipped.  That is, a
    complemented empty mask means no modifications are made to the output
    object at all, except perhaps to clear it in accordance with the
    \verb'GrB_OUTP' descriptor.  With a complemented mask, if the mask is
    present then \verb'Mask(i,j)=0' means that \verb'C(i,j)' is to be modified
    by the ${\bf C \langle M \rangle = Z}$ update.  Otherwise, if
    \verb'Mask(i,j)=1', then \verb'C(i,j)' is not modified, even if
    \verb'Z(i,j)' is an entry with a different value; that value is simply
    discarded.

    If the \verb'GrB_MASK' parameter is set to \verb'GrB_STRUCTURE',
    then the values of the mask are ignored, and just the pattern of the
    entries is used.  Any entry \verb'M(i,j)' in the pattern is treated as if
    it were true.

    The \verb'GrB_COMP' and \verb'GrB_STRUCTURE' settings can be combined,
    either by setting the mask option twice (once with each value), or by
    setting the mask option to \verb'GrB_COMP+GrB_STRUCTURE' (the latter is an
    extension to the specification).

    Using a parameter to complement the \verb'Mask' is very useful because
    constructing the actual complement of a very sparse mask is impossible
    since it has too many entries.  If the number of places in \verb'C'
    that should be modified is very small, then use a sparse mask without
    complementing it.  If the number of places in \verb'C' that should
    be protected from modification is very small, then use a sparse mask
    to indicate those places, and use a descriptor \verb'GrB_MASK' that
    complements the use of the mask.

\item \verb'GrB_INP0' and \verb'GrB_INP1' modify the use of the
    first and second input matrices \verb'A' and \verb'B' of the GraphBLAS
    operation.

    If the \verb'GrB_INP0' is set to \verb'GrB_TRAN', then \verb'A' is
    transposed before using it in the operation.  Likewise, if
    \verb'GrB_INP1' is set to \verb'GrB_TRAN', then the second input,
    typically called \verb'B', is transposed.

    Vectors and scalars are never transposed via the descriptor.  If a method's
    first parameter is a matrix and the second a vector or scalar, then
    \verb'GrB_INP0' modifies the matrix parameter and
    \verb'GrB_INP1' is ignored.  If a method's first parameter is a
    vector or scalar and the second a matrix, then \verb'GrB_INP1'
    modifies the matrix parameter and \verb'GrB_INP0' is ignored.

    To clarify this in each function, the inputs are labeled as
    \verb'first input:' and \verb'second input:' in the function signatures.

\item \verb'GxB_AxB_METHOD' suggests the method that should be
    used to compute \verb'C=A*B'.  All the methods compute the same result,
    except they may have different floating-point roundoff errors.  This
    descriptor should be considered as a hint; SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS is
    free to ignore it.

    \begin{itemize}

    \item \verb'GrB_DEFAULT' means that a method is selected automatically.

    \item \verb'GxB_AxB_SAXPY': select any saxpy-based method:
        \verb'GxB_AxB_GUSTAVSON', and/or
        \verb'GxB_AxB_HASH', or any mix of the two,
        in contrast to the dot-product method.

    \item \verb'GxB_AxB_GUSTAVSON':  an extended version of Gustavson's method
    \cite{Gustavson78}, which is a very good general-purpose method, but
    sometimes the workspace can be too large.  Assuming all matrices are stored
    by column, it computes \verb'C(:,j)=A*B(:,j)' with a sequence of {\em
    saxpy} operations (\verb'C(:,j)+=A(:,k)*B(k:,j)' for each nonzero
    \verb'B(k,j)').  In the {\em coarse Gustavson} method, each internal thread
    requires workspace of size $m$, to the number of rows of \verb'C', which is
    not suitable if the matrices are extremely sparse or if there are many
    threads.  For the {\em fine Gustavson} method, threads can share workspace
    and update it via atomic operations.  If all matrices are stored by row,
    then it computes \verb'C(i,:)=A(i,:)*B' in a sequence of sparse {\em saxpy}
    operations, and using workspace of size $n$ per thread, or group of
    threads, corresponding to the number of columns of \verb'C'.

    \item \verb'GxB_AxB_HASH':  a hash-based method, based on
        \cite{10.1145/3229710.3229720}.  It is very efficient for hypersparse
        matrices, matrix-vector-multiply, and when $|{\bf B}|$ is small.
        SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS includes a {\em coarse hash} method, in which
        each thread has its own hash workspace, and a {\em fine hash}
        method, in which groups of threads share a single hash workspace,
        as concurrent data structure, using atomics.

\item \verb'GxB_AxB_DOT': computes \verb"C(i,j)=A(i,:)*B(j,:)'", for each
    entry \verb'C(i,j)'.  If the mask is present and not complemented, only
    entries for which \verb'M(i,j)=1' are computed.  This is a very specialized
    method that works well only if the mask is present, very sparse, and not
    complemented, when \verb'C' is small, or when \verb'C' is bitmap or full.
    For example, it works very well
    when \verb'A' and \verb'B' are tall and thin, and \verb"C<M>=A*B'" or
    \verb"C=A*B'" are computed.  These expressions assume all matrices are in
    CSR format.  If in CSC format, then the dot-product method used for
    \verb"A'*B".  The method is impossibly slow if \verb'C' is large and the
    mask is not present, since it takes $\Omega(mn)$ time if \verb'C' is
    $m$-by-$n$ in that case.  It does not use any workspace at all.  Since it
    uses no workspace, it can work very well for extremely sparse or
    hypersparse matrices, when the mask is present and not complemented.

    \end{itemize}

\item \verb'GxB_SORT' provides a hint to \verb'GrB_mxm', \verb'GrB_mxv',
    \verb'GrB_vxm', and \verb'GrB_reduce' (to vector).  These methods can leave
    the output matrix or vector in a jumbled state, where the final sort is
    left as pending work.  This is typically fastest, since some algorithms can
    tolerate jumbled matrices on input, and sometimes the sort can be skipped
    entirely.  However, if the matrix or vector will be immediately exported in
    unjumbled form, or provided as input to a method that requires it to not be
    jumbled, then sorting it during the matrix multiplication is faster.
    By default, these methods leave the result in jumbled form (a {\em lazy
    sort}), if \verb'GxB_SORT' is set to zero (\verb'GrB_DEFAULT').  A nonzero
    value will inform the matrix multiplication to sort its result, instead.

\item \verb'GxB_COMPRESSION' selects the compression method for serialization.
    The default is ZSTD (level 1).  See Section~\ref{serialize_deserialize} for
    other options.

\end{itemize}

The next sections describe the methods for a \verb'GrB_Descriptor':

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{{\sf GrB\_Descriptor\_new:}  create a new descriptor}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\label{descriptor_new}

\begin{mdframed}[userdefinedwidth=6in]
{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
GrB_Info GrB_Descriptor_new     // create a new descriptor
(
    GrB_Descriptor *descriptor  // handle of descriptor to create
) ;
\end{verbatim} } \end{mdframed}

\verb'GrB_Descriptor_new' creates a new descriptor, with all fields set to
their defaults (output is not replaced, the mask is not complemented, the mask
is valued not structural, neither input matrix is transposed, the method
used in \verb'C=A*B' is selected automatically, and \verb'GrB_mxm' leaves
the final sort as pending work).

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{{\sf GrB\_Descriptor\_wait:} wait for a descriptor}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\label{descriptor_wait}

\begin{mdframed}[userdefinedwidth=6in]
{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
GrB_Info GrB_wait                   // wait for a descriptor
(
    GrB_Descriptor descriptor,      // descriptor to wait for
    int mode                        // GrB_COMPLETE or GrB_MATERIALIZE
) ;
\end{verbatim}
}\end{mdframed}

After creating a user-defined descriptor, a GraphBLAS library may choose to
exploit non-blocking mode to delay its creation.  Currently,
SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS does nothing except to ensure that \verb'd' is valid.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{{\sf GrB\_Descriptor\_free:} free a descriptor}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\label{descriptor_free}

\begin{mdframed}[userdefinedwidth=6in]
{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
GrB_Info GrB_free               // free a descriptor
(
    GrB_Descriptor *descriptor  // handle of descriptor to free
) ;
\end{verbatim} } \end{mdframed}

\verb'GrB_Descriptor_free' frees a descriptor.
Either usage:

    {\small
    \begin{verbatim}
    GrB_Descriptor_free (&descriptor) ;
    GrB_free (&descriptor) ; \end{verbatim}}

\noindent
frees the \verb'descriptor' and sets \verb'descriptor' to \verb'NULL'.  It
safely does nothing if passed a \verb'NULL' handle, or if
\verb'descriptor == NULL' on input.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Descriptor settings for \sf{GrB\_Vector} parameters}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\label{ijxvector}

Several methods GraphBLAS v10 accept \verb'GrB_Vector' parameters for their index
lists \verb'I' and \verb'J', which appear only as \verb'uint64_t *' C arrays in
the v2.1 C Specification.  Likewise, several methods accept a \verb'GrB_Vector'
parameter \verb'X', where the related method in the Specification accepts only
a raw C array of a given type.

By default, \verb'GrB_Vector' inputs \verb'I', \verb'J', and \verb'X' are
interpretted as if their values are first extracted with
\verb'GrB_Vector_extractTuples', where the values are extracted in order (with
ascending indices), and their values are then passed to the method.
The actual method is much faster; GraphBLAS uses the values directly.

This behavior can be revised via the descriptor for the method.  Three settings
are available:

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb'GxB_ROWINDEX_LIST': how the \verb'GrB_Vector I' is intrepretted.
\item \verb'GxB_COLINDEX_LIST': how the \verb'GrB_Vector J' is intrepretted.
\item \verb'GxB_VALUE_LIST': how \verb'GrB_Vector X' is intrepretted (for \verb'GrB_build' only).
\end{itemize}

These can be set to one of the following values:

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb'GrB_DEFAULT' or \verb'GxB_USE_VALUES': use the values of the vector (default).

\item \verb'GxB_USE_INDICES': use the indices of the vector.
    This acts as if the indices are first extracted into a C array with
    \verb'GrB_Vector_extractTuples', where the indices are extracted in ascending order,
    and then this C array is then passed to the method.
    The actual method is much faster; GraphBLAS uses the indices directly.

\item \verb'GxB_IS_STRIDE': use the values, of size 3, for a strided range,
    or \verb'lo:inc:hi' in MATLAB notation.  This usage is limited to the
    \verb'I' and \verb'J' vectors (except this option may not be used for
    \verb'GrB_build').  The vector must have exactly three entries, 
    \verb'lo', \verb'hi', and \verb'inc', in that order.

\end{itemize}

The \verb'GxB_IS_STRIDE' option is fully described in Section~\ref{colon}.  In
that section, there are many options available.  Here, the \verb'GrB_Vector'
\verb'I' or \verb'J' must have length exactly three.  The first entry present
is the start of the sequence (\verb'lo'), the second entry is the end of the
sequence (\verb'hi') and the third entry is the stride (\verb'inc').  This
corresponds to the \verb'GxB_STRIDE' option when passing a \verb'uint64_t *'
array.  To use a stride of one, simply set the third entry to 1; this
corresponds to the \verb'GxB_RANGE' option when passing a \verb'uint64_t *'
array.  To use a negative stride, simply pass in the vector with a signed data
type (\verb'GrB_INT32' or \verb'GrB_INT64' as appropriate; this corresponds to
the \verb'GxB_BACKWARDS' option desribed in Section~\ref{colon}).
These three values appear in this order to be consistent \verb'GxB_BEGIN' (0),
\verb'GxB_END' (1), \verb'GxB_INC' (2).

When using the \verb'_Vector' methods, the \verb'GrB_Vector' objects \verb'I',
\verb'J', and \verb'X' may be sparse.  If the vectors are sparse,
\verb'GrB_Vector_extractTuples' returns a dense list of indices or values, and
this is how the \verb'I,J,X' vectors may be used in the new methods in
GraphBLAS v10 with the \verb'_Vector' suffix at then end of their name.

To use the \verb'GrB_ALL' option, specifying all the rows or columns of a
matrix or all indices of a vector, pass in the corresponding \verb'GrB_Vector'
\verb'I' or \verb'J' as a NULL pointer.

\subsubsection{{\sf GrB\_DESC\_*:}  built-in descriptors}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\label{descriptor_predefined}

Built-in descriptors are listed in the table below.  A dash in the table
indicates the default.  These descriptors may not be modified or freed.
Attempts to modify them result in an error (\verb'GrB_INVALID_VALUE'); attempts
to free them are silently ignored.

% \verb'GrB_NULL' is the default descriptor, with all settings at their defaults:
% \verb'OUTP': do not replace the output,
% \verb'MASK': mask is valued and not complemented,
% \verb'INP0': first input not transposed, and
% \verb'INP1': second input not transposed.
% For these pre-defined descriptors, the
% \verb'GxB_SORT' setting is at their default values.
