\label{objects}

GraphBLAS defines twelve different objects to represent matrices, vectors,
scalars, data types, operators (binary, unary, and index-unary), monoids,
semirings, a {\em descriptor} object used to specify optional parameters
that modify the behavior of a GraphBLAS operation, and a {\em context}
object for controlling computational resources.

The GraphBLAS API makes a distinction between {\em methods} and {\em
operations}.  A method is a function that works on a GraphBLAS object, creating
it, destroying it, or querying its contents.  An operation (not to be confused
with an operator) acts on matrices and/or vectors in a semiring.

\verb'GrB_UnaryOp'   & a unary operator $z=f(x)$, where $z$ and $x$ are scalars\\
\verb'GrB_BinaryOp'  & a binary operator $z=f(x,y)$, where $z$, $x$, and $y$ are scalars\\
\verb'GrB_IndexUnaryOp'  & an index-unary operator \\
\verb'GxB_IndexBinaryOp'  & an index-binary operator \\
\verb'GrB_Monoid'    & an associative and commutative binary operator  \\
                     & and its identity value \\
\verb'GrB_Semiring'  & a monoid that defines the ``plus'' and a binary operator\\
                     & that defines the ``multiply'' for an algebraic semiring \\
\verb'GrB_Matrix'    & a 2D sparse matrix of any type \\
\verb'GrB_Vector'    & a 1D sparse column vector of any type \\
\verb'GrB_Scalar'    & a scalar of any type \\
\verb'GrB_Descriptor'& a collection of parameters that modify an operation \\
\verb'GxB_Context'   & allocating computational resources \\
\verb'GxB_Container' & for moving data between GraphBLAS and a user application \\

Most of these objects are implemented in C as an opaque handle, which is a
pointer to a data structure held by GraphBLAS.  User applications may not
examine the content of the object directly; instead, they can pass the handle
back to GraphBLAS which will do the work.  Assigning one handle to another
is valid but it does not make a copy of the underlying object.

The \verb'GxB_Container' object is non-opaque but contains opaque objects
as its contents.  All other objects are entirely opaque.
